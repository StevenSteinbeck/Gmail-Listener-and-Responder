As a Part of My Automated Account Ledger Downloading, Processing, and Delivery System for Dental Health Care Providers 

This tool is for use on Windows 10 systems which use Open Dental as their choice of practice management software

Running this Program:
- Will monitor a user specified folder in your gmail inbox, awaiting emails upon refresh that have the subject format of "Lname Fname" and contian the word "ledger"
     - This was developed for automated, accurate ledger generation by front desk employees who had to bill bustomers who had a balance. This allowed them to receive a printable .xlsx file containing their entire formatted and formulated account ledger in under 2 minutes simpoly by sending an email.
     
- Once one or a batch of emails containing this criteria are found, the information is sorted and dispatched to my Open Dental ledger creation export functions which produce a .xls file

- These are later passed to excel macros for formatting and formulating of the spreadsheet, and conversion of .xls to .xlsx

- This created ledger is then gathered by my send email function and sent to the email who sent the request.
